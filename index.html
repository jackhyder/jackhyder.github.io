                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I have been an experimenter and tinkerer for my entire life. I tried a career in biochemistry, 
                    but after some time I realized my true calling was with software and web engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In late 2016 I decided to take the plunge and put myself on a fast track to learn the skills I would need
                    to transfer into a brand new industry. I attended the Coding Dojo in Bellevue, WA where I launched into a 
                    fast-paced and immersive introduction to Web Development. Focusing on 3 languages, I learned the essentials 
                    of algorithms, MVC patterns, and full stack applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I now spend my time honing my skills, learning new coding techniques, and building real-world projects. If
                    you would like to get in contact with me, shoot me an email or a message through LinkedIn and let's chat!

                    <p class="project_description">
                        Stop Clickbait! is an open-source project to build a browser extension to fight clickbait on social 
                        media, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the Frontend and mostly PHP and JavaScript on the Backend. Clickbait is a technique that uses exaggerated or misleading headlines to pull users into 
                        reading articles, often with the intent to push users through many pages to get to the heart of the 
                        actual content. Because of the current model of web-based advertising, this brings in a lot of revenue
                        for the website hosts without providing meaningful content to the users. Our extension will allow users 
                        to flag and report these parasitic articles to allow for community-sourced curation of media. Expect a launch
                        sometime in the second half of 2017!

                        DojoLyfe was the last project I worked on at the coding bootcamp that I attended. Working on a small 
                        team in technologies we had never used before, we built a 2D RPG-style game in the Unity game engine using 
                        C# in just under a week.

                        UptimeMap was my introduction to team-based coding projects. On a team of 6 people, we built a full stack 
                        application that tracked the responsiveness of servers in different geographical locations. The application 
                        was also our introduction to using version control in the form of git and GitHub, and was built using the 
                        MEAN stack and Google Maps API.
